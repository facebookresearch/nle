# Contributing to nle
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Getting Started
NLE is direct fork of [NetHack](https://github.com/nethack/nethack) and 
therefore contains code that operates on many different levels of abstraction.
This ranges from low-level game logic, to the higher-level administration of 
repeated nethack games, and finally to binding of these games to Python `gym`
environment.

If you want to learn more about how the architecture of `nle` and how it works
under the hood, checkout the [architecture document](./ARCHITECTURE.md). This 
may be useful for anyone looking to contribute the lower level elements of NLE.
