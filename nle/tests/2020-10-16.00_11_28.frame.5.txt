                                       It is written in the Book of Amaterasu Omikami:

                                           After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
                                           against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
                   --------------          Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
                   .............|          the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
                   |d..........{|          and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
                   |...........d|          Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.
                   |..........@..
                   ---------+----      Your goddess Amaterasu Omikami seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
                                       to gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.

                                       You, a newly trained Hatamoto, have been heralded
                                       from birth as the instrument of Amaterasu Omikami.  You are destined
                                       to recover the Amulet for your deity, or die in the
                                       attempt.  Your hour of destiny has come.  For the sake
                                       of us all:  Go bravely with Amaterasu Omikami!
